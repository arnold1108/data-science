## Recommender System for Matching HealthCare Professionals with Jobs Using Cosine Similarity 

A healthcare staffing company has the potential to offer a convenient platform that connects healthcare facilities with pre-screened healthcare professionals such as nurses and medical technicians. The platform could use an algorithm to match professionals with facilities based on their skills and availability, creating a staffing solution that operates similarly to Uber. The company's marketplace would allow facilities to post job opportunities with specific requirements and schedules, and pre-qualified healthcare professionals would be notified of relevant job openings. The first person to accept the job would be booked and paid for their services, eliminating the need for traditional staffing agencies and providing a more streamlined and cost-effective process.

The company could also offer a pitching service for facilities to select the best candidates for their job opportunities and provide workforce management tools to manage their entire workforce, including employees and contractors. The use of technology could create a comprehensive solution for healthcare staffing needs, offering flexibility and efficiency for both facilities and professionals. The company's innovative approach has the potential to transform the healthcare staffing industry.

In addition, the company could use machine learning systems to improve the healthcare staffing industry. The system would use advanced algorithms to match healthcare professionals with facilities based on their skill set, experience, and availability. A recommendation system, specifically collaborative filtering, could be used to analyze data points such as past job performance to make the most accurate and efficient matches.

To construct a collaborative filtering recommendation system, the following steps need to be taken:

* Develop a user-item matrix: A matrix where each row represents a professional, and each column represents a job. The values in the matrix represent the interactions between the professionals and the jobs.

* Split the data: Divide the user-item matrix into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the recommendation system, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

* Select a similarity metric: Select a similarity metric that can measure the similarity between users or items. Cosine similarity is a common metric.

* Calculate user and item similarities: Once a similarity metric has been selected, compute the similarities between the users and items.

* Provide recommendations: Finally, we can use the similarities to provide recommendations for each user. For instance, we can suggest the top N jobs that a user is most likely to be interested in, based on their past behavior and the behavior of similar users.
